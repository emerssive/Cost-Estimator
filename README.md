# Cost Estimator Tool

## Project Overview

The **Cost Estimator Tool** is a web-based application designed to help sales teams quickly generate project cost estimates. The tool asks critical project questions, allows users to upload requirement documents, and provides a cost estimate based on predefined rules. All input and output data are stored for future learning and improvement of the estimation logic.

## Key Features
